# YZ_Project 1 - Technical Documentation Page

## User Stories

### FCC Acceptance Tests

#### Content

- [] I can see an `<article>` element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
- [] Within the #main-doc `<article>` element, I can see several `<section>` elements, each with aclassof"main-section". There should be a minimum of 5.
- [] The first element within each .main-section should be a `<header>` element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
- [] Each `<section>` element with the class of "main-section" should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each `<header>` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The `<section>` that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
- [] The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 `<p>` elements total (not each).
- [] The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 `<code>` elements total (not each).
- [] The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 `<li>` items total (not each).
- [] I can see a `<nav>` element with a corresponding id="navbar".
- [] The first element within the navbar should be a `<header>` which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
- [] Additionally, the navbar should contain link, `<a>`, elements with the class of "nav-link". There should be one for every element with the class "main-section".
- [] Each element with the class of "nav-link" should contain text that corresponds to the `<header>` text within each `<section>` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
- [] When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `<section>` element that has that id and contains the corresponding `<header>`.

#### Layout

- [] On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
- [] My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

### My User Stories

- [] As a user, I can use a sidebar to scroll through different sections.
- [] As a user, I can type words into a search bar to search for technical terms.
- [] As a user, when I hover above a technical term, a popup appears containing an explanation of the word's meaning. When I hover away from the technical term, the popup disappears so I can continue reading.
